## Running the Application

### Development Server

Start the application using http-server:

```bash
npm start
```
The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:8080`

or

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will open automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`

### Login Credentials

The application uses JSONPlaceholder's user data for demo authentication. You can log in with any of these usernames (password can be anything):

- Username: `Bret` (Password: any)
- Username: `Antonette` (Password: any)

- Username: `Karianne` (Password: any)

*More usernames available from [JSONPlaceholder Users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)*

## Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run tests once (CI mode)

```bash
npm run test:single
```

### Test Coverage

Tests achieve >70% code coverage and include:
- Authentication Service tests
- Task Service tests
- Controller tests (Login, Task List, Task Form)
- Both positive and negative test scenarios

View coverage report in `coverage/` directory after running tests.

## 🎨 Application Pages

### 1. Login Page (`/login`)
- User authentication with username/password
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Redirect to tasks after successful login

### 2. Task List Page (`/tasks`)
- Display all tasks in a grid layout
- Statistics cards showing task counts
- Search functionality
- Filter by status
- Sort by multiple criteria
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit/Delete actions
- Responsive design

### 3. Add/Edit Task Page (`/tasks/new`, `/tasks/edit/:id`)
- Form with fields: Title, Description, Status, Due Date
- Client-side validation
- Character counters
- Error messages
- Cancel confirmation

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns

**Module Pattern**: Separate modules for authentication, tasks, filters, and directives

**Controller-as Syntax**: Using `vm` (view model) for better code organization

**Service Layer**: Business logic separated into reusable services

**Route Guards**: Protected routes requiring authentication

**localStorage**: Data persistence for tasks and authentication tokens

### API Integration

The application integrates with [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/):

- `/users` - User authentication (mock)
- `/todos` - Task data source

### Data Enhancement

Since JSONPlaceholder's todos API lacks some fields, the application enhances tasks with:
- Auto-generated descriptions
- Random due dates (within 30 days)
- Status field (Pending/In Progress/Completed)
- Editable flag (false for completed tasks)
- Timestamps (created, updated, completed)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

All tests are written using **Jasmine** and run with **Karma**.

**Test Coverage Includes:**

1. **Services**
   - AuthService: login, logout, token management
   - TaskService: CRUD operations, data persistence

2. **Controllers**
   - LoginController: authentication flow
   - TaskListController: task display, filtering, sorting
   - TaskFormController: form validation, submission

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Positive flows (successful operations)
   - Negative flows (error handling)
   - Edge cases (empty data, invalid inputs)

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run tests matching a pattern
karma start karma.conf.js --grep="AuthService"
```

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
2. **Naming Conventions**: Consistent file and variable naming
3. **Comments**: Meaningful comments explaining complex logic
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. **Validation**: Client-side validation with meaningful messages
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
7. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper form labels
8. **Performance**: Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms

## Assumptions & Enhancements

### Assumptions

1. **Mock Authentication**: Using JSONPlaceholder users for demo purposes
2. **Mock API**: CRUD operations simulate API calls but use localStorage
3. **Data Enhancement**: Generated descriptions and due dates for tasks
4. **Single User Session**: Application supports one user at a time

### Enhancements Made

1. **Statistics Dashboard**: Visual overview of task counts
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Multiple filter and sort options
3. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
4. **User Feedback**: Loading states, error messages, confirmations
5. **Data Persistence**: localStorage for offline capability
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: >70% code coverage
